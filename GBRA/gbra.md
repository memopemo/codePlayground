# GameBoy RetroArch Save Syncer
Syncs multiple folders (listed in dirs.txt) with each duplicate in other directories.

Usage: ./gbra.sh [file-to-sync]

TODO: if an argument doesnt exist, do it for each save file in each directory.

This was mostly for syncing my save files from my physical GameBoy with Retroarch.
